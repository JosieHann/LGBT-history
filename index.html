    <p>A common practice in many cities, the New York Police Department would occasionally raid bars and restaurants where gays and lesbians were known to gather. This occurred on June 28, 1969, when the NYPD raided the Stonewall Inn, a bar in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan.

        When the police aggressively dragged patrons and employees out of the bar, several people fought back against the NYPD, and a growing crowd of angry locals gathered in the streets. The confrontations quickly escalated and sparked six days of protests and violent clashes with the NYPD outside the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street and throughout the neighborhood. 
        
        By the time the Stonewall Riots ended on July 2, 1969, the gay rights movement went from being a fringe issue largely ignored by politicians and the media to front-page news worldwide.
        On June 28, 1970, on the one year anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, the first Pride marches were held in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Thousands of LGBT+ people gathered to commemorate Stonewall and demonstrate for equal rights.

    The Fight  <i class="fa-solid fa-shield-heart fa-beat-fade"></i>
</h3>
<p>
    Discrimination against LGBTI people undermines the human rights principles outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
     Yet discrimination and violence against people in the LGBTI community are all too common. Homophobic, biphobic and transphobic
     attitudes remain deeply embedded in many cultures around the world.
